# Data Structures

## Introduction to the Project

In this project, you will implement six different functions that cover a variety of topics related to the data structures you've learned in this course. The topics covered in these questions include arrays, linked lists, trees, heaps, and graphs. You will write up a clean and efficient answer in Python, as well as a text explanation of the efficiency of your code and your design choices.
